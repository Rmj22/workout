Have you been at work and heard someone talk about a workout that helped them but no your not going to remember it by the time you get home?This app allow you to do that and more. When the user starts that app they will be prompted to add an exercise resistance or cardio (sorry no yoga in this version), the user will fill in information such as duration, distance, weight(dont worry not your weight), reps etc. That exercise is then added to the user dashboard. After the user performs the exercise they will go back to the app where they will be prompted with their last workout and the option to continue with that workout or add another. Happy Running!
